			<h2>Fake Product Identification</h2>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Harness the power of blockchain technology to combat counterfeit products
				and ensure authenticity across the supply chain. Our innovative solution uses a decentralized, immutable
				ledger to record every product transaction, from production to delivery. Consumers can verify product
				authenticity in real-time by scanning a QR code or RFID tag that reveals the product’s complete history.
				This system not only boosts consumer confidence but also enhances security, operational efficiency, and
				significantly reduces the presence of counterfeit goods in the market. Join us in building a more
				transparent and trustworthy shopping environment.</p>

					The whole supply chain management had recently faced issues such as redundancy, lack of standardization and poor coordination in between several firm resulting in lack of transparency and authenticity of the products. It has also adverse effect on the economic growth of the original manufacturers and business through heavy revenue loss, defamation and trust hindrance, stealing sales, downtime, replacement expenses and the amount spent on fighting for counterfeiting. Many methods have been devised in the past to overcome the problem of counterfeiting. The most common method used are by using RFID tag(Radio Frequency Identification tag), Artificial Intelligence. The idea of this project is to improve the detection of fake product by tracking its supply chain history, this is achieved through Machine learning and as well as Blockchain Technology as the immutable characteristic of the Blockchain provides more security and transparency in the transactions of the proposed system. Blockchain based systems makes everything decentralized that may be accessed by several nodes(users) at the same time. The counterfeit products are identified using camera scanner, where QR of the product or goods is linked to a blockchain to store product details and guaranteed unique code of each product stored as blocks in the database. If the code in product matches, the notification will be sent to the customer indicating the authenticity of the product and else if it does not match the code in database, a notification will be sent to customer indicating that product is original or counterfeited and notification is also sent to manufacturer about the place of purchase if customer accepts the request made by the application. One of the main advantage is that the recorded data is difficult to change without the majority consent of most of the users or nodes in the existing network which makes the data much more secure and also highly protected reducing its risk to vulnerabilities. This paper presents the system proposed for the solution of the above mentioned problem using blockchain technology for detection of the counterfeit products from the original one. This approach is done to cut down the fake products that the consumers won’t completely rely on merchants to determine if the products are original or fake.

						<li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> The immutable nature of blockchain ensures that once data is recorded, it cannot be altered without network consensus, providing robust protection against fraud.</li>
						<li><strong>Transparency and Traceability:</strong> Every transaction and product journey is recorded on a transparent ledger, visible to all participants, enhancing trust and accountability in the supply chain.</li>
						<li><strong>Seller and Customer options:</strong> Sellers can list their available products to sell to customers and Consumers can keep track of their purchases which they have made.</li>
						<li><strong>Reduced Costs and Efficiencies:</strong> By automating many aspects of the supply chain and reducing the need for intermediaries, blockchain can help lower costs and improve operational efficiency.</li>
						<li><strong>Consumer Confidence:</strong> Customers can verify the authenticity of products in real time via an accessible digital history, building trust and satisfaction with your brand.</li>
						<li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> Decentralized nature of blockchain allows multiple parties to access the system simultaneously without compromising data integrity, making it resilient and reliable.</li>
